		<p>Below screenshot shows the rendered page, Elements tab, and JavaScript Console window for when I changed the circle radii and colors during the example in the section Creating SVG Elements Based on Data, "Styling SVG Elements Based on Data".

		<p>Below SVG shows my solution from above.</p>
		<script src="StylingSVGElementsBasedOnData.js"></script>
		<p>This example works by first creating an array that will hold the values for the each circle's radius. Next a SVG element is appended to the page's body.</br>
		The SVG element will then be appended with the SVG circles. The values from the array is binded to the SVG circle data. Up until now, circles are not displayed.</br>
		We only have three SVG circle elements on the page. Next, we will provide the attributes of the circle. The attributes provider are coordinates of the circle,</br>
		radius, and color. When providing the radius attribute, a function is called to use the binded data of the SVG circle element as the radius. Furthermore, to make</br>
		each circle a different color, a custom function was used to check the value of the binded data and assign the color accordingly. To modify each circle's radius</br>
		and color, I created a function that would check the value of the binded data, and assign a new radius and color to each binded value. </p>

		<p>Below SVG shows my solution for changing the value in the spaceCircles dataset to change the position of the circles, and to change the colors used.</p>
		<script src="SVGCoordinateSpaceSolution.js"></script>
		<p>This example works by first creating an array that will hold the values for each of the circle's location. Next a SVG element is appeneded to the page's body.</br>
		The SVG element is then appeneded with SVG circles, and the values from the array is binded to the circle element. Next the attribute of the circles are provided.</br>
		A function is called to use the binded data of the circle element as the X and Y coordinate, the fill of each circle is assigned by checking the value of the binded</br>
		data. To be able to move the circles to a new position, I created the array spaceCircles again with new values. Then I selected all the SVG circle elements and binded</br>
		the new values from spaceCircles. When setting the attribute, I used the function to use the value of the binded data to set the X and Y coordinate. Finally, to adjust</br>
		the color, a function was created to check the value of the binded data, and adjust the fill accordingly.</p>
	</div>
	<div>
		<p>The SVG coordinate system differs from the typical math coordinate system in that the 0,0 coordinate is in the top-left hand corner rather than bottom-left.</br>
		Just like the typical math coordinate system, the X coordinate grows from left to right, but the Y coordinate grows from top to bottom. Instead of moving up the graph</br>
		as the Y coordinate increases, we would travse downwards as the Y coordinate increases.
